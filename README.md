# Purrfect LeetCode

> "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players;  
> They have their exits and their entrances;  
> And one man in his time plays many parts."  
> â€” William Shakespeare, *As You Like It*

As a programmer, I will transition through many different stages throughout my career. Each IDE is a stage, and each field, whether it's AI/ML, Computer Vision, iOS development, Security, or Algorithms, is like a different play in which I perform. In this single lifetime, I will live many lives, taking on new roles as I grow. Each role is like claiming a new glass mask, offering me something new to learn and a new self to become.

This repository documents my journey of deliberately practicing data structures and algorithms through LeetCode. My goal isnâ€™t just to solve problems. Itâ€™s about persistence and consistency. By approaching each problem thoughtfully, I hope to strengthen my skills and deepen my understanding. Each solution reflects my growth and dedication.

This journey reminds me that technical excellence doesnâ€™t come from bursts of brilliance but from steady, consistent work. As a programmer, I constantly face the fear of failure, imposter syndrome, and the need to start over again. But I keep moving forward. I am always overcoming before becoming. I decide who I want to be in each moment. I try to keep a belief that every obstacle can be conquered, and that no problem is beyond solving.

*To Maya,  
who reminds me that even when no one is watching, the performance must go on.  
Quiet persistence is still a kind of brilliance.*
